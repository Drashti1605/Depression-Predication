            <p>we are dedicated to supporting mental health through a scientific, ethical, and human-centered approach to early depression detection. Our platform was created with the belief that mental well-being deserves the same level of attention and care as physical health, and that prevention and early awareness can make a critical difference in people's lives. Unlike many modern tools that rely heavily on artificial intelligence and automated decision-making, we have consciously chosen not to use any AI technologies in our prediction methods. Instead, our system is built upon well-established psychological assessment models, clinical research, and manually curated screening methodologies developed in consultation with mental health professionals. Our goal is to offer a transparent, trustworthy, and user-friendly experience that empowers individuals to better understand their emotional health. Every step of our process is guided by compassion, privacy, and scientific integrity, ensuring that users receive insightful information without compromising their data or relying on black-box algorithms. Whether you're here out of curiosity, concern, or a desire to take control of your mental health journey, we are here to support you with tools grounded in evidence—not artificial intelligence.</p>
